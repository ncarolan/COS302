# COS 302 / SML 305 / ECE 305: Mathematics for Numerical Computing and Machine Learning

This repository holds my work for COS 302, a class offered at Princeton University. I'm doing the assignments to refresh my mathematical understanding. 

I follow the readings and assigments from the Fall 2023 version of the course, linked [here](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall23/cos302/).

TODO: Add Overleaf and Colab links for all assignments.
